# Introduction

As web applications become more advanced and more common, so do web application vulnerabilities. Among the most common types of web application vulnerabilities are [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) vulnerabilities. XSS vulnerabilities take advantage of a flaw in user input sanitization to "write" JavaScript code to the page and execute it on the client side, leading to several types of attacks.

---

## What is XSS

A typical web application works by receiving the HTML code from the back-end server and rendering it on the client-side internet browser. When a vulnerable web application does not properly sanitize user input, a malicious user can inject extra JavaScript code in an input field (e.g., comment/reply), so once another user views the same page, they unknowingly execute the malicious JavaScript code.

XSS vulnerabilities are solely executed on the client-side and hence do not directly affect the back-end server. They can only affect the user executing the vulnerability. The direct impact of XSS vulnerabilities on the back-end server may be relatively low, but they are very commonly found in web applications, so this equates to a medium risk (`low impact + high probability = medium risk`), which we should always attempt to `reduce` risk by detecting, remediating, and proactively preventing these types of vulnerabilities.

## XSS Attacks

XSS vulnerabilities can facilitate a wide range of attacks, which can be anything that can be executed through browser JavaScript code. A basic example of an XSS attack is having the target user unwittingly send their session cookie to the attacker's web server. Another example is having the target's browser execute API calls that lead to a malicious action, like changing the user's password to a password of the attacker's choosing. There are many other types of XSS attacks, from Bitcoin mining to displaying ads.

As XSS attacks execute JavaScript code within the browser, they are limited to the browser's JS engine (i.e., V8 in Chrome). They cannot execute system-wide JavaScript code to do something like system-level code execution. In modern browsers, they are also limited to the same domain of the vulnerable website. Nevertheless, being able to execute JavaScript in a user's browser may still lead to a wide variety of attacks, as mentioned above. In addition to this, if a skilled researcher identifies a binary vulnerability in a web browser (e.g., a Heap overflow in Chrome), they can utilize an XSS vulnerability to execute a JavaScript exploit on the target's browser, which eventually breaks out of the browser's sandbox and executes code on the user's machine.

XSS vulnerabilities may be found in almost all modern web applications and have been actively exploited for the past two decades. A well-known XSS example is the [Samy Worm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samy_\(computer_worm\)), which was a browser-based worm that exploited a stored XSS vulnerability in the social networking website MySpace back in 2005. It executed when viewing an infected webpage by posting a message on the victim's MySpace page that read, "Samy is my hero." The message itself also contained the same JavaScript payload to re-post the same message when viewed by others. Within a single day, more than a million MySpace users had this message posted on their pages. Even though this specific payload did not do any actual harm, the vulnerability could have been utilized for much more nefarious purposes, like stealing users' credit card information, installing key loggers on their browsers, or even exploiting a binary vulnerability in user's web browsers (which was more common in web browsers back then).

In 2014, a security researcher accidentally identified an [XSS vulnerability](https://blog.sucuri.net/2014/06/serious-cross-site-scripting-vulnerability-in-tweetdeck-twitter.html) in Twitter's TweetDeck dashboard. This vulnerability was exploited to create a [self-retweeting tweet](https://twitter.com/derGeruhn/status/476764918763749376) in Twitter, which led the tweet to be retweeted more than 38,000 times in under two minutes. Eventually, it forced Twitter to [temporarily shut down TweetDeck](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/11/twitter-tweetdeck-xss-flaw-users-vulnerable) while they patched the vulnerability.

To this day, even the most prominent web applications have XSS vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Even Google's search engine page had multiple XSS vulnerabilities in its search bar, the most recent of which was in [2019](https://www.acunetix.com/blog/web-security-zone/mutation-xss-in-google-search/) when an XSS vulnerability was found in the XML library. Furthermore, the Apache Server, the most commonly used web server on the internet, once reported an [XSS Vulnerability](https://blogs.apache.org/infra/entry/apache_org_04_09_2010) that was being actively exploited to steal user passwords of certain companies. All of this tells us that XSS vulnerabilities should be taken seriously, and a good amount of effort should be put towards detecting and preventing them.

## Types of XSS

There are three main types of XSS vulnerabilities:

|Type|Description|
|---|---|
|`Stored (Persistent) XSS`|The most critical type of XSS, which occurs when user input is stored on the back-end database and then displayed upon retrieval (e.g., posts or comments)|
|`Reflected (Non-Persistent) XSS`|Occurs when user input is displayed on the page after being processed by the backend server, but without being stored (e.g., search result or error message)|
|`DOM-based XSS`|Another Non-Persistent XSS type that occurs when user input is directly shown in the browser and is completely processed on the client-side, without reaching the back-end server (e.g., through client-side HTTP parameters or anchor tags)|

# Stored XSS

---

Before we learn how to discover XSS vulnerabilities and utilize them for various attacks, we must first understand the different types of XSS vulnerabilities and their differences to know which to use in each kind of attack.

The first and most critical type of XSS vulnerability is `Stored XSS` or `Persistent XSS`. If our injected XSS payload gets stored in the back-end database and retrieved upon visiting the page, this means that our XSS attack is persistent and may affect any user that visits the page.

This makes this type of XSS the most critical, as it affects a much wider audience since any user who visits the page would be a victim of this attack. Furthermore, Stored XSS may not be easily removable, and the payload may need removing from the back-end database.

We can start the server below to view and practice a Stored XSS example. As we can see, the web page is a simple `To-Do List` app that we can add items to. We can try typing `test` and hitting enter/return to add a new item and see how the page handles it:

![[Pasted image 20250213111405.png]]

As we can see, our input was displayed on the page. If no sanitization or filtering was applied to our input, the page might be vulnerable to XSS

## XSS Testing Payloads

We can test whether the page is vulnerable to XSS with the following basic XSS payload:

```html
<script>alert(window.origin)</script>
```

We use this payload as it is a very easy-to-spot method to know when our XSS payload has been successfully executed. Suppose the page allows any input and does not perform any sanitization on it. In that case, the alert should pop up with the URL of the page it is being executed on, directly after we input our payload or when we refresh the page

![[Pasted image 20250213111530.png]]

As we can see, we did indeed get the alert, which means that the page is vulnerable to XSS, since our payload executed successfully. We can confirm this further by looking at the page source by clicking [`CTRL+U`] or right-clicking and selecting `View Page Source`, and we should see our payload in the page source:

```html
<div></div><ul class="list-unstyled" id="todo"><ul><script>alert(window.origin)</script>
</ul></ul>
```

	Tip: Many modern web applications utilize cross-domain IFrames to handle user input, so that even if the web form is vulnerable to XSS, it would not be a vulnerability on the main web application. This is why we are showing the value of `window.origin` in the alert box, instead of a static value like `1`. In this case, the alert box would reveal the URL it is being executed on, and will confirm which form is the vulnerable one, in case an IFrame was being used.

As some modern browsers may block the `alert()` JavaScript function in specific locations, it may be handy to know a few other basic XSS payloads to verify the existence of XSS. One such XSS payload is `<plaintext>`, which will stop rendering the HTML code that comes after it and display it as plaintext. Another easy-to-spot payload is `<script>print()</script>` that will pop up the browser print dialog, which is unlikely to be blocked by any browsers. Try using these payloads to see how each works. You may use the reset button to remove any current payloads.

To see whether the payload is persistent and stored on the back-end, we can refresh the page and see whether we get the alert again. If we do, we would see that we keep getting the alert even throughout page refreshes, confirming that this is indeed a `Stored/Persistent XSS` vulnerability. This is not unique to us, as any user who visits the page will trigger the XSS payload and get the same alert.

# Reflected XSS

---

There are two types of `Non-Persistent XSS` vulnerabilities: `Reflected XSS`, which gets processed by the back-end server, and `DOM-based XSS`, which is completely processed on the client-side and never reaches the back-end server. Unlike Persistent XSS, `Non-Persistent XSS` vulnerabilities are temporary and are not persistent through page refreshes. Hence, our attacks only affect the targeted user and will not affect other users who visit the page.

`Reflected XSS` vulnerabilities occur when our input reaches the back-end server and gets returned to us without being filtered or sanitized. There are many cases in which our entire input might get returned to us, like error messages or confirmation messages. In these cases, we may attempt using XSS payloads to see whether they execute. However, as these are usually temporary messages, once we move from the page, they would not execute again, and hence they are `Non-Persistent`.

We can start the server below to practice on a web page vulnerable to a Reflected XSS vulnerability. It is a similar `To-Do List` app to the one we practiced with in the previous section. We can try adding any `test` string to see how it's handled

![[Pasted image 20250213112500.png]]

As we can see, we get `Task 'test' could not be added.`, which includes our input `test` as part of the error message. If our input was not filtered or sanitized, the page might be vulnerable to XSS. We can try the same XSS payload we used in the previous section and click `Add`

![[Pasted image 20250213112854.png]]

Once we click `Add`, we get the alert pop-up

![[Pasted image 20250213112914.png]]

In this case, we see that the error message now says `Task '' could not be added.`. Since our payload is wrapped with a `<script>` tag, it does not get rendered by the browser, so we get empty single quotes `''` instead. We can once again view the page source to confirm that the error message includes our XSS payload

```html
<div></div><ul class="list-unstyled" id="todo"><div style="padding-left:25px">Task '<script>alert(window.origin)</script>' could not be added.</div></ul>
```


As we can see, the single quotes indeed contain our XSS payload `'<script>alert(window.origin)</script>'`.

If we visit the `Reflected` page again, the error message no longer appears, and our XSS payload is not executed, which means that this XSS vulnerability is indeed `Non-Persistent`.

`But if the XSS vulnerability is Non-Persistent, how would we target victims with it?`

This depends on which HTTP request is used to send our input to the server. We can check this through the Firefox `Developer Tools` by clicking [`CTRL+Shift+I`] and selecting the `Network` tab. Then, we can put our `test` payload again and click `Add` to send it

![[Pasted image 20250213113137.png]]

As we can see, the first row shows that our request was a `GET` request. `GET` request sends their parameters and data as part of the URL. So, `to target a user, we can send them a URL containing our payload`. To get the URL, we can copy the URL from the URL bar in Firefox after sending our XSS payload, or we can right-click on the `GET` request in the `Network` tab and select `Copy>Copy URL`. Once the victim visits this URL, the XSS payload would execute:

```
http://94.237.59.180:40620/index.php?task=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
```

![[Pasted image 20250213113229.png]]

# DOM XSS

---

The third and final type of XSS is another `Non-Persistent` type called `DOM-based XSS`. While `reflected XSS` sends the input data to the back-end server through HTTP requests, DOM XSS is completely processed on the client-side through JavaScript. DOM XSS occurs when JavaScript is used to change the page source through the `Document Object Model (DOM)`.

We can run the server below to see an example of a web application vulnerable to DOM XSS. We can try adding a `test` item, and we see that the web application is similar to the `To-Do List` web applications we previously used

![[Pasted image 20250213113902.png]]
However, if we open the `Network` tab in the Firefox Developer Tools, and re-add the `test` item, we would notice that no HTTP requests are being made

We see that the input parameter in the URL is using a hashtag `#` for the item we added, which means that this is a client-side parameter that is completely processed on the browser. This indicates that the input is being processed at the client-side through JavaScript and never reaches the back-end; hence it is a `DOM-based XSS`.

Furthermore, if we look at the page source by hitting [`CTRL+U`], we will notice that our `test` string is nowhere to be found. This is because the JavaScript code is updating the page when we click the `Add` button, which is after the page source is retrieved by our browser, hence the base page source will not show our input, and if we refresh the page, it will not be retained (i.e. `Non-Persistent`). We can still view the rendered page source with the Web Inspector tool by clicking [`CTRL+SHIFT+C`]

![[Pasted image 20250213114106.png]]

## Source & Sink

To further understand the nature of the DOM-based XSS vulnerability, we must understand the concept of the `Source` and `Sink` of the object displayed on the page. The `Source` is the JavaScript object that takes the user input, and it can be any input parameter like a URL parameter or an input field, as we saw above.

On the other hand, the `Sink` is the function that writes the user input to a DOM Object on the page. If the `Sink` function does not properly sanitize the user input, it would be vulnerable to an XSS attack. Some of the commonly used JavaScript functions to write to DOM objects are:

- `document.write()`
- `DOM.innerHTML`
- `DOM.outerHTML`

Furthermore, some of the `jQuery` library functions that write to DOM objects are:

- `add()`
- `after()`
- `append()`

If a `Sink` function writes the exact input without any sanitization (like the above functions), and no other means of sanitization were used, then we know that the page should be vulnerable to XSS.

We can look at the source code of the `To-Do` web application, and check `script.js`, and we will see that the `Source` is being taken from the `task=` parameter

```javascript
var pos = document.URL.indexOf("task=");
var task = document.URL.substring(pos + 5, document.URL.length);
```

Right below these lines, we see that the page uses the `innerHTML` function to write the `task` variable in the `todo` DOM:

```javascript
document.getElementById("todo").innerHTML = "<b>Next Task:</b> " + decodeURIComponent(task);
```

So, we can see that we can control the input, and the output is not being sanitized, so this page should be vulnerable to DOM XSS.

---

## DOM Attacks

If we try the XSS payload we have been using previously, we will see that it will not execute. This is because the `innerHTML` function does not allow the use of the `<script>` tags within it as a security feature. Still, there are many other XSS payloads we use that do not contain `<script>` tags, like the following XSS payload:

```
<img src="" onerror=alert(window.origin)>
```

The above line creates a new HTML image object, which has a `onerror` attribute that can execute JavaScript code when the image is not found. So, as we provided an empty image link (`""`), our code should always get executed without having to use `<script>` tags:

![[Pasted image 20250213114440.png]]

To target a user with this DOM XSS vulnerability, we can once again copy the URL from the browser and share it with them, and once they visit it, the JavaScript code should execute. Both of these payloads are among the most basic XSS payloads. There are many instances where we may need to use various payloads depending on the security of the web application and the browser, which we will discuss in the next section.

# XSS Discovery

---

By now, we should have a good understanding of what an XSS vulnerability is, the three types of XSS, and how each type differs from the others. We should also understand how XSS works through injecting JavaScript code into the client-side page source, thus executing additional code, which we will later learn how to utilize to our advantage.

In this section, we will go through various ways of detecting XSS vulnerabilities within a web application. In web application vulnerabilities (and all vulnerabilities in general), detecting them can become as difficult as exploiting them. However, as XSS vulnerabilities are widespread, many tools can help us in detecting and identifying them.

---

## Automated Discovery

Almost all Web Application Vulnerability Scanners (like [Nessus](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus), [Burp Pro](https://portswigger.net/burp/pro), or [ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/)) have various capabilities for detecting all three types of XSS vulnerabilities. These scanners usually do two types of scanning: A Passive Scan, which reviews client-side code for potential DOM-based vulnerabilities, and an Active Scan, which sends various types of payloads to attempt to trigger an XSS through payload injection in the page source.

While paid tools usually have a higher level of accuracy in detecting XSS vulnerabilities (especially when security bypasses are required), we can still find open-source tools that can assist us in identifying potential XSS vulnerabilities. Such tools usually work by identifying input fields in web pages, sending various types of XSS payloads, and then comparing the rendered page source to see if the same payload can be found in it, which may indicate a successful XSS injection. Still, this will not always be accurate, as sometimes, even if the same payload was injected, it might not lead to a successful execution due to various reasons, so we must always manually verify the XSS injection.

Some of the common open-source tools that can assist us in XSS discovery are [XSS Strike](https://github.com/s0md3v/XSStrike), [Brute XSS](https://github.com/rajeshmajumdar/BruteXSS), and [XSSer](https://github.com/epsylon/xsser). We can try `XSS Strike` by cloning it to our VM with `git clone`:

```bash
 
 git clone https://github.com/s0md3v/XSStrike.git
 cd XSStrike
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 python xsstrike.py

```

We can then run the script and provide it a URL with a parameter using `-u`. Let's try using it with our `Reflected XSS` example from the earlier section

```bash
python xsstrike.py -u "http://SERVER_IP:PORT/index.php?task=test" 

        XSStrike v3.1.4

[~] Checking for DOM vulnerabilities

```

As we can see, the tool identified the parameter as vulnerable to XSS from the first payload. `Try to verify the above payload by testing it on one of the previous exercises. You may also try testing out the other tools and run them on the same exercises to see how capable they are in detecting XSS vulnerabilities.`

---

## Manual Discovery

When it comes to manual XSS discovery, the difficulty of finding the XSS vulnerability depends on the level of security of the web application. Basic XSS vulnerabilities can usually be found through testing various XSS payloads, but identifying advanced XSS vulnerabilities requires advanced code review skills.

---

#### XSS Payloads

The most basic method of looking for XSS vulnerabilities is manually testing various XSS payloads against an input field in a given web page. We can find huge lists of XSS payloads online, like the one on [PayloadAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/XSS%20Injection/README.md) or the one in [PayloadBox](https://github.com/payloadbox/xss-payload-list). We can then begin testing these payloads one by one by copying each one and adding it in our form, and seeing whether an alert box pops up.


	Note: XSS can be injected into any input in the HTML page, which is not exclusive to HTML input fields, but may also be in HTTP headers like the Cookie or User-Agent (i.e., when their values are displayed on the page).

You will notice that the majority of the above payloads do not work with our example web applications, even though we are dealing with the most basic type of XSS vulnerabilities. This is because these payloads are written for a wide variety of injection points (like injecting after a single quote) or are designed to evade certain security measures (like sanitization filters). Furthermore, such payloads utilize a variety of injection vectors to execute JavaScript code, like basic `<script>` tags, other `HTML Attributes` like `<img>`, or even `CSS Style` attributes. This is why we can expect that many of these payloads will not work in all test cases, as they are designed to work with certain types of injections.

This is why it is not very efficient to resort to manually copying/pasting XSS payloads, as even if a web application is vulnerable, it may take us a while to identify the vulnerability, especially if we have many input fields to test. This is why it may be more efficient to write our own Python script to automate sending these payloads and then comparing the page source to see how our payloads were rendered. This can help us in advanced cases where XSS tools cannot easily send and compare payloads. This way, we would have the advantage of customizing our tool to our target web application. However, this is an advanced approach to XSS discovery, and it is not part of the scope of this module.

## Code Review

The most reliable method of detecting XSS vulnerabilities is manual code review, which should cover both back-end and front-end code. If we understand precisely how our input is being handled all the way until it reaches the web browser, we can write a custom payload that should work with high confidence.

In the previous section, we looked at a basic example of HTML code review when discussing the `Source` and `Sink` for DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities. This gave us a quick look at how front-end code review works in identifying XSS vulnerabilities, although on a very basic front-end example.

We are unlikely to find any XSS vulnerabilities through payload lists or XSS tools for the more common web applications. This is because the developers of such web applications likely run their application through vulnerability assessment tools and then patch any identified vulnerabilities before release. For such cases, manual code review may reveal undetected XSS vulnerabilities, which may survive public releases of common web applications. These are also advanced techniques that are out of the scope of this module. Still, if you are interested in learning them, the [Secure Coding 101: JavaScript](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/secure-coding-101-javascript) and the [Whitebox Pentesting 101: Command Injection](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/whitebox-pentesting-101-command-injection) modules thoroughly cover this topic.
